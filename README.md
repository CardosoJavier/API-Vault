# API Vault Documentation

## Project Concept
API Vault is a cross-platform desktop application designed for engineering college students. It aims to speed up the 
development of small applications and quick prototypes by providing effortless access, retrieval, secure storage, and 
best practices of API keys. The application uses industry-accepted practices to secure sensitive user data.

## Project Vision
